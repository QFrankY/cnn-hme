# Hierarchical Mixture of Experts for Image Classification

The Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HME) ensemble method can be utilized to combine various expert image classifiers to perform classification on a wider number of image classes. The main benefits of this approach is faster training and better interpretability in comparison to deep learning models and other ensemble techniques. In addition, minor test accuracy improvements were observed during experimentation on multiple datasets.

The approach was tested on two different multi-class image datasets:
- Fashion MNIST
- KIMIA Path960

The included paper details the approach and experimental results. Jupyter notebooks used for the experiments are also included.
